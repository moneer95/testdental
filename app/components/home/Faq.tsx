            question: "What's is the structure of ORE 1?",
            answer: `
                It consists of two computer-based exam papers:
                - Paper A covers clinically applied dental science and clinically applied human disease.
                - Paper B covers aspects of clinical dentistry, including law and ethics and health and safety.
                Each paper lasts three hours and is made up of multiple short answer questions (extended matching questions and single best answer questions).
